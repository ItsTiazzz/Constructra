# Constructra
Constructra is a totally new take on tech mods.  
Want to create spaghetti belt systems? Go ahead, if it works it works, and bonus points if it's more efficient too.  
Wanna absolutely deforest your entire world ending the life of circa 274 organisms to make space for your next big bionuclear cluster bomb factory? Go. Ahead.

All jokes - which corporate has forced me to call them - aside, you can create almost anything to achieve your goal in some way or another.  
This mod aims to add a more streamlined gameflow of building _your_ future. No more loose ends, just a straight to the point storyline that will force you to expand in only one direction, with optional alternatives of course, but it all ends up the same.

## Config
If you happen to be stuck, or don't like a particular part of the gameflow, you are probably happy to hear this mod is highly configurable:
```json5
insert config here
```
> [!NOTE]  
> This can be found in `run/config/constructra.json5`

## Hey I am developur tis mot is kewl how do I mak adon??!!?
This mod as an `api` package you can resort to, as of writing (28/01/2025 16:21 UTC+1) the only documentation you will have to go off of would be JavaDocs in the sources alone, but once the API is a little more refined, and the mod in a wayyyy better state, we will probably release better and more fluent documentation here on the GitHub Wiki, and if I personally finally find out how to make proper MkDocs stuff, perhaps through a dedicated site.
