        Hello! Welcome to Constructra!
        This mod is a massive work in progress, so to keep everything organized and tidy, I have created this.
        In here I will put various things that I want to keep track of, and will be updated as I go.
        This class will not have any code in it that you should directly use, just comments or other stuff.

       TODO LIST
        - Think about whether I want to completely change the base game or actually keep some functionality.
          (Like disabling certain items, or bigger such as the health system)
          - Getting rid of a lot of recipes might be a good idea.
