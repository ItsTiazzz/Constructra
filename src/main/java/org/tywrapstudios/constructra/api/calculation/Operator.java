/**
 * <h1>Operators</h1>
 * Operators are used to perform operations, more often called calculations, on a set of numbers.
 * <p>They can have different precedences and should be handled accordingly inside an equation, as indicated by PEMDAS.</p>
 * <h3>PEMDAS</h3>
 * PEMDAS is an acronym for the words parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction.
 * Given two or more operations in a single expression, the order of the letters in PEMDAS tells you what to calculate first, second, third and so on, until the calculation is complete.
 * <p>This is important to contain consistency with similar equations, that have a different order in which the numbers were placed.
 * (Do note {@link Associativity} applies)</p>
